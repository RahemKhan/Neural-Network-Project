## A comparative study in diagnosing Diabetes through Multilayer Perceptron and Support Vector Machine
* Integrated two classifiers (MLP and SVC) to the diabetes dataset and formed a comparasion.
* Tuned the moodels hyperparameters via grid search and 10-fold cross validation.
* The best MLP model had an accuracy of 0.74.
* The best SVC model had an accuracy of 0.76.
